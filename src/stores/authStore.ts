/**
 * Auth state.
 *
 * Security model (Phase 11.3 — closes audit finding C2):
 *  - **Refresh token** lives in an httpOnly cookie set by the API. JS
 *    never sees it.
 *  - **Access token** lives in **memory only**. It's NOT persisted to
 *    localStorage, so an XSS payload (eg. compromised admin in blog
 *    rich-text) can't lift a working API token from `azm-auth`.
 *  - **User** is persisted to localStorage so the UI doesn't blank
 *    out on reload.
 *  - On rehydrate, if a user exists but no access token, we eagerly
 *    call `/api/auth/refresh` once to mint a fresh access token from
 *    the cookie. If that fails (cookie expired / revoked), we clear
 *    the user — same behaviour as a real logout.
